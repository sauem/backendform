                            product quality, reduce or no defect rate. At the same time, they also apply the quality

                            USVN puts product quality to the top priority, so in 2020-2021 USVN's Cloth Mask products
                            are well received in the US and Western markets. Our products are selling so well that all
                            goods were sold out within 2 hours right after arriving at the US airport. Currently, we
                            have exported to the US about 6 million Cloth Masks produced at our garment factories in
                            Vietnam.
